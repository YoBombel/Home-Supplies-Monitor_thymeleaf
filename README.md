<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Home Supplies Monitor is a pet project that was developed as a way to learn and practice CRUD (create, read, update,
delete) operations using Spring Boot and Java. In addition to learning these technologies, the project also incorporates
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Docker to provide a robust and polished web application.

While the project was initially developed as a way to exercise and improve coding skills, it has also been designed with
a focus on real-life usability. The goal of the Home Supplies Monitor is to provide households with a convenient and
easy-to-use tool for tracking their daily essentials and supplies, and helping them stay organized and on top of their
household needs.
